# Progress
To track my progress of learning new concepts 
This repository contains various items I have created or compiled from different sources to help me on my cybersecurity/programming journey.

I want other people to be able to follow along and hopefully, one day someone new will find this repository realizing if THAT guy can incrementally improve their skills over time, they can DEFINITELY do it too.
